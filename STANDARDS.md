# Front-end development standards



Since we are moving away from ngrx with rest, towards a more malleable architecture that is based on services and GraphQL we need some standards for the business logic that will make the application as homogeneous as if we were using ngrx. This document aims at describing the standards we will put in place.


## CRUD operations:



## Filtering & pagination:



## Realtime:



## Linking entities:



## File Architecture:



## Subscription in service:
 Services that do request


## Mutation:



## Class vs Interface for entities:



## Error Handling:



## Optimistic UI:



## Basic properties creation
